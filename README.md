From [Wikipedia, "Adaptive Radiation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_radiation#Cichlid_fish):

> Another famous example is the cichlid fishes in lakes of the East African Rift. The lakes in this area are believed to support and sustain about 2,000 different species of these fish, each with different ecological and morphological characteristics such as body size.[9] Like the Gal√°pagos Islands, these lakes form a fragmented landscape that isolates the cichlid fish from one another, allowing them, and many of the organisms they live with, to evolve separately. The diversity of the lakes is in fact quite extraordinary because the adaptive radiations here are sometimes so young.
